# ChocolateQuestRepoured
CQ Repoured is a rewrite of the classic Chocolate Quest, Better Dungeons, and Dungeon Items Minecraft mods.

Currently we're busy with updating our codebase to 1.20.1. 
If you're experienced with modding and want to help, please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/StWzzFw) and let us know!

To use, please head to our Website or curseforge page and download the latest stable build.
Please refer to the curseforge page, our website, the wiki or our discord for informations as those are more up to date than this readme file.

The mod is dependant on reachfix and geckolib.

The jenkins does N O T run yet as we dont want to bother with players complaining about instability.
The jenkins will be active once we got the first alpha out and the mod is playable in terms of stability.~~
